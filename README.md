## Installation

For using the mod, you need to have <b>[JaLoader](https://github.com/theLeaxx/JaLoader)</b> installed.

Then, you just have to [download](https://github.com/MeblIkea/Jalopy-PaperPlease/releases) the mod from the Releases, and you can drag & drop both DLL and the folder, in the **Mods** folder in your Jalopy folder (the one that you can choose while setuping Jaloader).<br><br>
